1. Create a git repo and clone it in local
2. create code.py and add code to it (it will save csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc
# pip install DVC is not installed
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir s3" (created a new s3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will ask to do: (git rm -r -cached 'data' and git commit -m "stop tracking data")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"  
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push" 
10. Do a git add commit push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
13. Then git add commit push (we are saving V2 of our data at this point)
13. Chedk dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
14. Repete same steps 11 - 13for V3 of data.
