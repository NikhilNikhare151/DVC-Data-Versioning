1. Create a git repo and clone it in local
2. create code.py and add code to it (it will save csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc
# pip install DVC is not installed
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir s3" (created a new s3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will ask to do: (git rm -r -cached 'data' and git commit -m "stop tracking data")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
